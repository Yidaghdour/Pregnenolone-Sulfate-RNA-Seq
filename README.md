# Pregnenolone-Sulfate-RNA-Seq
Expanded T cells were non-activated or activated through the T cell receptor with CD3/CD28 Dyna Beads for 24 hours. They were subsequently untreated or treated with 200 ÂµM of pregnenolone sulfate (PS) for 2 or 24 hours. We additionally included a "basal" condition that involved no activation or treatment at 0 hours (time of activation).

## DESeq2 was used to run the differential gene expression analysis for four comparisons:
A- 2-hours PS-treated vs untreated TCR-activated samples
B- 2-hours PS-treated vs untreated non-activated samples
C- 24-hours PS-treated vs untreated TCR-activated samples
D- 24-hours PS-treated vs untreated non-activated samples
