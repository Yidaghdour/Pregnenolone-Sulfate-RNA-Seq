Expanded T cells were non-activated or activated through the T cell receptor with CD3/CD28 Dyna Beads for 24 hours. They were subsequently treated or untreated with 200 ÂµM of pregnenolone for 2 or 24 hours. We additionally included a "basal" condition that involved no activation or treatment at 0 hours (time of activation).
